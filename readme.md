## Installation

You just need to clone this repo like:

```groovy
git clone https://github.com/JoshimOfficial/FIPY_downloader.git
```


## Usage (Most important)

First of all create a DB named `yt_scraper` then create a table named `webfixer` with id, url, created_date, and created_time column.
set as  

- id = int (primary);
- url = varchar;
- created_date = date;
- created_time = time.

And now manually insert a data url to that `webfixer` as your current `localhost` project `location` like:

- if you run the project from this location:
http://localhost/downloader/FIPY_downloader/


- then you should insert data to `webfixer` in `url` as:
http://localhost/downloader/FIPY_downloader



- Note: Never put the slashes `/` to the end like: 

http://localhost/tailwind/10/test/FIPY_downloader/

This is wrong way.



- You should put the url like:

http://localhost/tailwind/10/test/FIPY_downloader


Now run you project index.php file to your localhost.
